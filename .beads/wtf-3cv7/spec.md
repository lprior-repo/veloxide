# BEAD: wtf-3cv7 - procedural: Implement wait_for_signal in WorkflowContext

id: "wtf-3cv7"
title: "procedural: Implement wait_for_signal in WorkflowContext"
type: feature
priority: 1
effort_estimate: "1hr"
labels: [procedural, signals, context, durable-execution]

clarification_status: "RESOLVED"

resolved_clarifications:
  - question: "How does wait_for_signal handle the checkpoint/replay pattern?"
    answer: "Same dual-phase pattern as activity() and sleep(): (1) load op_counter, (2) check checkpoint_map for a completed signal under that op_id, (3) if checkpoint exists (replay), return the signal payload immediately and increment counter, (4) if no checkpoint (live), register as a signal waiter and yield Pending."
    decided_by: "Existing pattern in context.rs:51-96 (activity) and context.rs:99-144 (sleep)"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "Where are received signals buffered before a waiter registers?"
    answer: "A new `received_signals: HashMap<String, Bytes>` field on ProceduralActorState. When a signal arrives and no waiter exists, it is buffered. When wait_for_signal is called and a matching entry exists, it is consumed immediately."
    decided_by: "No signal buffering exists yet in InstanceState or ProceduralActorState — must be added."
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "What new InstanceMsg variants are needed?"
    answer: "Two new variants on InstanceMsg: (1) ProceduralWaitForSignal { operation_id: u32, signal_name: String, reply: RpcReplyPort<Result<Bytes, WtfError>> } for the context to request waiting, (2) The existing InjectSignal path must be extended to check waiters and buffer undelivered signals."
    decided_by: "InstanceMsg at messages/instance.rs:52-94 — follows the ProceduralDispatch/ProceduralSleep pattern."
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "How are pending signal waiters tracked in InstanceState?"
    answer: "New field on InstanceState: `pending_signal_calls: HashMap<String, RpcReplyPort<Result<Bytes, WtfError>>>` keyed by signal_name. This mirrors pending_activity_calls (state.rs:27) and pending_timer_calls (state.rs:31)."
    decided_by: "InstanceState at instance/state.rs:13-38 — same pattern as pending_activity_calls and pending_timer_calls."
    date: "2026-03-23"

assumptions:
  - assumption: "ProceduralActorState is Clone (state/mod.rs:30 derives Clone)"
    validation_method: "See state/mod.rs:30: #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]"
    risk_if_wrong: "apply_event clone pattern would break — trivially caught at compile"
  - assumption: "WorkflowEvent::SignalReceived { signal_name: String, payload: Bytes } exists in wtf-common"
    validation_method: "See crates/wtf-common/src/events/mod.rs:71"
    risk_if_wrong: "Cannot replay signal events — but this is a core event type, already defined"
  - assumption: "InstanceMsg::InjectSignal already exists at messages/instance.rs:59-63"
    validation_method: "See messages/instance.rs:59-63"
    risk_if_wrong: "Signal delivery path already established via API -> orchestrator -> instance"
  - assumption: "The handle_inject_event_msg at handlers.rs:87-113 already routes ActivityCompleted and TimerFired to wake pending RPC ports"
    validation_method: "See handlers.rs:94-111"
    risk_if_wrong: "Must follow same pattern for SignalReceived in event replay path"

ears_requirements:
  ubiquitous:
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL allow procedural workflow code to block on wait_for_signal(signal_name) until the named signal is received"
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL persist signal receipt via WorkflowEvent::SignalReceived to the event log for durable replay"
  event_driven:
    - trigger: "WHEN wait_for_signal is called and a matching signal is already buffered in received_signals"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return the buffered payload immediately and remove it from received_signals"
    - trigger: "WHEN wait_for_signal is called and no matching signal is buffered"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL register a pending signal waiter in pending_signal_calls and suspend the workflow task until the signal arrives"
    - trigger: "WHEN a signal is received (InjectSignal) and a pending waiter exists for that signal_name"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL deliver the signal payload to the waiter via its RpcReplyPort and remove the waiter"
    - trigger: "WHEN a signal is received (InjectSignal) and no pending waiter exists"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL buffer the signal in received_signals for a future wait_for_signal call"
    - trigger: "WHEN the event log replays a WorkflowEvent::SignalReceived during crash recovery"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL create a checkpoint entry in ProceduralActorState.checkpoint_map so wait_for_signal returns immediately on replay"
  unwanted:
    - condition: "IF the same signal_name is waited on twice before the first completes"
      shall_not: "THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT lose signals — each wait_for_signal call consumes one buffered signal"
      because: "Duplicate wait_for_signal calls are a logic error but must not corrupt state"

      answered: true
      answer: "No — it falls into the catch-all `_ =>` branch at line 279 which only inserts into applied_seq. Must add SignalReceived handling that creates a checkpoint entry."
    - question: "What is the return type of wait_for_signal?"
      answered: true
      answer: "anyhow::Result<Bytes> — same as activity(). Bytes carries the signal payload."
    - question: "How does handle_signal (stub) currently work?"
      answered: true
      answer: "handlers.rs:116-129 — it logs and returns Ok(()) via reply port. Must be extended to check pending_signal_calls and buffer in received_signals."

    Key facts for context recovery:
    - wait_for_signal follows the activity()/sleep() dual-phase pattern in context.rs
    - Phase 0: Add received_signals to ProceduralActorState, pending_signal_calls to InstanceState, ProceduralWaitForSignal to InstanceMsg
    - Phase 0: Add SignalReceived handling to apply_event (creates checkpoint from payload)
    - Phase 1: Extend handle_signal to check waiters then buffer; add ProceduralWaitForSignal to handle_procedural_msg; extend handle_inject_event_msg
    - Phase 2: Implement wait_for_signal on WorkflowContext — checkpoint check then ProceduralWaitForSignal call

  design_decisions:
    - decision: "received_signals uses HashMap<String, Vec<Bytes>> not HashMap<String, Bytes>"
      rationale: "Multiple signals of the same name can arrive before a waiter registers. Vec preserves FIFO order."
      reversible: true
    - decision: "SignalReceived in apply_event creates checkpoint from event payload directly"
      rationale: "On replay, the event already contains the payload. No need to track separate signal state for replay — checkpoint_map is the source of truth."
      reversible: false
    - decision: "InjectSignal reply remains Result<(), WtfError> — waiter reply is separate"
      rationale: "InjectSignal is the external API contract (POST /workflows/:id/signals). The waiter is internal plumbing. Changing InjectSignal reply type would break the API handler."
      reversible: false
    - decision: "wait_for_signal returns anyhow::Result<Bytes> not Result<SignalPayload, ...>"
      rationale: "Consistent with activity() which also returns Result<Bytes>. Signal payload is opaque bytes — the workflow interprets them."
      reversible: false

ai_hints:
  do:
    - "Read context.rs activity() method FIRST — it is the canonical pattern to follow exactly"
    - "Follow the exact op_counter pattern: load for checkpoint check, fetch_add(1) AFTER consuming result"
    - "Use received_signals.entry(signal_name).or_default().push(payload.clone()) for buffering"
    - "Use received_signals.entry(signal_name).or_default().pop() for consuming (VecDeque would be better but HashMap<String, Vec> is simpler)"
    - "Add #[serde(default)] to received_signals to handle snapshots created before this field existed"
    - "Match the exact RpcReplyPort type: RpcReplyPort<Result<Bytes, WtfError>>"
    - "In apply_event, the SignalReceived arm must also remove from received_signals to keep buffer clean during replay"
    - "In handle_inject_event_msg, after applying SignalReceived event, check pending_signal_calls and wake the waiter"
  do_not:
    - "Do NOT use .unwrap() or .expect() — use match or map_err"
    - "Do NOT change the WorkflowEvent::SignalReceived variant in wtf-common"
    - "Do NOT change the InjectSignal reply type in InstanceMsg"
    - "Do NOT increment op_counter before the checkpoint check — load first, increment after"
    - "Do NOT use tokio::sync::watch or broadcast for signal delivery — RpcReplyPort is the established pattern"
    - "Do NOT make received_signals a single-value HashMap<String, Bytes> — use Vec to handle multiple arrivals"
    - "Do NOT implement waiter timeout in this bead — that is a separate concern"
  constitution:
    - "Zero unwrap law: NEVER use .unwrap() or .expect()"
    - "Functional first: Use match and map_err over if-else for error handling"
    - "Test first: Write tests before implementation code"
    - "Existing patterns: Follow the activity()/sleep() dual-phase pattern exactly"
    - "Deterministic replay: Every path through wait_for_signal must produce identical results on replay"
