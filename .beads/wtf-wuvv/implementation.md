# Implementation Summary

## Bead: wtf-wuvv
## Title: Graceful Worker Shutdown

## Implemented

- Confirmed and extended graceful shutdown contracts in worker runtime:
  - `DrainConfig` and `ShutdownResult` types exist in `crates/wtf-worker/src/worker.rs`.
  - Added unit tests for drain configuration:
    - default timeout is 30 seconds
    - zero-duration drain config rejected by constructor
- Preserved existing run-loop semantics while keeping shutdown result reporting.

## Contract coverage notes

- `DrainConfig::new(Duration::ZERO, ...)` now explicitly tested as invalid.
- `ShutdownResult` fields remain populated by run loop for completed/interrupted/drain duration reporting.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p wtf-worker -- --nocapture`

## Files changed

- `crates/wtf-worker/src/worker.rs`
