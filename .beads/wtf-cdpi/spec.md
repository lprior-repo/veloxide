# BEAD: wtf-cdpi - definitions: Store definition source in KV after lint

id: "wtf-cdpi"
title: "definitions: Store definition source in KV after lint"
type: feature
priority: 1
effort_estimate: "30min"
labels: [definitions, kv, storage]

clarification_status: "RESOLVED"

resolved_clarifications:
  - question: "What format should definitions be stored in KV?"
    answer: "Raw source string as UTF-8 bytes, as-is from the POST body field `source`"
    decided_by: "NEXT.md Action Item 1, line 61"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "What is the KV key format for definitions?"
    answer: "`<namespace>/<workflow_type>` — but since the current endpoint has no namespace, use `default/<workflow_type>` as the key via `definition_key()`"
    decided_by: "kv.rs:161 definition_key() signature requires namespace + workflow_type"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "Should we store even when diagnostics contain warnings (valid=true but non-empty diagnostics)?"
    answer: "Yes — store when `valid == true` (no error-severity diagnostics). Warnings are acceptable."
    decided_by: "definitions.rs:21 valid = dtos.iter().all(|d| d.severity != \"error\")"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "The current DefinitionRequest only has `source`, no `workflow_type`. Where does workflow_type come from?"
    answer: "Add `workflow_type: String` field to DefinitionRequest. This is needed as the KV key component."
    decided_by: "NEXT.md Action Item 1 line 61 says 'key = workflow_type'; DefinitionRequest at requests.rs:22-24 only has source"
    date: "2026-03-23"

assumptions:
  - assumption: "KV bucket wtf-definitions already exists (provisioned by provision_kv_buckets in kv.rs:77-90)"
    validation_method: "Called in serve.rs during startup via provision_kv_buckets()"
    risk_if_wrong: "Store put will fail if bucket not provisioned — but provision_kv_buckets is idempotent"
  - assumption: "KvStores is already injected as Extension<KvStores> in app.rs:66"
    validation_method: "See app.rs:66 .layer(Extension(kv))"
    risk_if_wrong: "Handler cannot access KV without the Extension"
  - assumption: "async_nats::jetstream::kv::Store::put(&self, key: &str, value: Bytes) -> Result<SequencePair, KvError>"
    validation_method: "See kv.rs:125 and lib.rs:79 for existing usage patterns"
    risk_if_wrong: "Wrong API signature would cause compile error — trivially caught"

ears_requirements:
  ubiquitous:
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL persist workflow definitions to NATS KV after successful lint validation"
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL store raw source text (not JSON-wrapped) as the KV value"
  event_driven:
    - trigger: "WHEN a definition passes lint validation (valid == true)"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL store the raw source in KV bucket wtf-definitions with key = definition_key(\"default\", workflow_type)"
    - trigger: "WHEN KV store operation fails"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with ApiError { error: \"kv_store_failure\", message: <detail> }"
    - trigger: "WHEN the lint produces error-severity diagnostics (valid == false)"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with DefinitionResponse { valid: false, diagnostics } and NOT store in KV"
    - trigger: "WHEN the source fails to parse entirely (lint returns Err)"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with ApiError { error: \"parse_error\", message: <detail> } and NOT store in KV"
  unwanted:
    - condition: "IF the definition fails lint (parse error or error-severity diagnostics)"
      shall_not: "THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT store the definition in KV"
      because: "Invalid definitions would corrupt the workflow registry and cause immediate termination when loaded"

    - "Do NOT use unwrap() or expect() on KV operations — use map_err"
    - "Do NOT change the DefinitionResponse format or add new fields"
    - "Do NOT change the HTTP status codes for existing paths (200 for valid/invalid, 400 for parse error)"
    - "Do NOT store definitions when valid == false"
    - "Do NOT wrap the source in JSON before storing — store raw UTF-8 bytes"
    - "Do NOT use the path param _definition_type as the KV key — use req.workflow_type from the body"
  constitution:
    - "Zero unwrap law: NEVER use .unwrap() or .expect()"
    - "Functional first: Use map_err over if-else for error conversion"
    - "Test first: Tests MUST exist before implementation"
    - "Existing patterns: Follow the Store::put pattern from kv.rs:125 and lib.rs:79"
