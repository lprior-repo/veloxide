# Implementation Summary

- Removed silent `u32::MAX` casting degradation. It now returns an explicit 500 error on sequence overflow.
- Cleaned up JSON decoding. Swallowing `.ok()` failures replaced with proper error propagation mapped to HTTP 500.
- `actor_error` refactored to `internal_error` to decouple internal abstraction details from the public REST API contract.
- Added comprehensive happy path testing that builds a mock EventStore for `wtf-api` tests.
