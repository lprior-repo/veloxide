title: "e2e: Test terminate workflow"
type: task
priority: 1
effort_estimate: "1hr"
labels: [e2e, terminate, integration-test, journal]

clarification_status: "RESOLVED"

resolved_clarifications:
  - question: "What is the full terminate request flow?"
    answer: "DELETE /api/v1/workflows/<namespace>/<instance_id> -> axum terminate_workflow handler -> OrchestratorMsg::Terminate -> handle_terminate in master -> InstanceMsg::Cancel -> handle_cancel in instance handlers -> publishes WorkflowEvent::InstanceCancelled to JetStream via EventStore -> myself_ref.stop(Some(reason))"
    decided_by: "workflow.rs:70-95, terminate.rs:8-48, handlers.rs:143-175"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "How do we verify InstanceCancelled appears in the journal?"
    answer: "GET /api/v1/workflows/<namespace>/<instance_id>/journal returns JournalResponse with JournalEntry list. The InstanceCancelled event maps to JournalEntryType::Run with status='recorded' via the catch-all arm in map_event_fields at journal.rs:183-191"
    decided_by: "journal.rs:183-191, map_event_fields catch-all arm"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "What paradigm should the test workflow use?"
    answer: "Procedural with a long sleep (e.g. 60000ms) to keep the instance alive while the DELETE is issued. FSM or DAG also work if a definition is registered. Procedural is simplest because it requires only registering a WorkflowFn, not a full definition."
    decided_by: "actor.rs:57-59 starts procedural workflow in pre_start; start.rs spawns with paradigm from request"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "Where should the E2E test file live?"
    answer: "New file crates/wtf-actor/tests/terminate_e2e.rs as an integration test (tests/ directory, not #[cfg(test)] in src). This requires spawning real Ractor actors and a live NATS JetStream connection."
    decided_by: "Workspace convention — integration tests with external deps go in tests/"
    date: "2026-03-23"
  - question: "How to verify the actor actually stopped?"
    answer: "After sending InstanceMsg::Cancel, call actor_ref.get_status(). If the actor stopped, this returns Err (ActorExitStatus) or we can use a oneshot channel in post_stop. Simpler: use ActorRef::is_alive() or monitor the supervised link. Most practical: after terminate succeeds, attempt GetStatus on the orchestrator — it should return NOT_FOUND (ActorDied)."
    decided_by: "workflow_mappers.rs:122-126 maps GetStatusError::ActorDied to 404"
    date: "2026-03-23"

assumptions:
  - assumption: "NATS server is running in Docker container wtf-nats-test on localhost:4222"
    validation_method: "AGENTS.md specifies this; cargo run -p wtf-storage --bin nats_connect_test"
    risk_if_wrong: "All integration tests fail with connection refused — non-recoverable in test"
  - assumption: "JetStream stream wtf-events is provisioned (via provision_streams)"
    validation_method: "Called during startup; provision.rs provisions wtf-events stream"
    risk_if_wrong: "append_event() fails with stream not found error"
  - assumption: "wtf-storage NatsClient implements EventStore trait (lib.rs:41-64)"
    validation_method: "See lib.rs:40-64 — EventStore impl for NatsClient delegates to journal::append_event"
    risk_if_wrong: "Cannot compile — would be caught immediately"
  - assumption: "The terminate handler in instance/handlers.rs:143-175 always calls myself_ref.stop(Some(reason)) after publishing InstanceCancelled"
    validation_method: "Line 173: myself_ref.stop(Some(reason))"
    risk_if_wrong: "Actor might remain alive after cancel — test would hang or timeout"
  - assumption: "OrchestratorState tracks active instances in HashMap<InstanceId, ActorRef<InstanceMsg>> (state.rs:42)"
    validation_method: "state.rs:42 — active field"
    risk_if_wrong: "handle_terminate would fail to find the instance"

ears_requirements:
  ubiquitous:
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL support terminating a running workflow instance via DELETE /api/v1/workflows/:id"
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL record a WorkflowEvent::InstanceCancelled event in the JetStream journal before stopping the actor"
    - "THE SYSTEM SHALL stop the WorkflowInstance actor after successful cancellation"
  event_driven:
    - trigger: "WHEN DELETE /api/v1/workflows/<ns>/<id> is received for a running instance"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 204 No Content on successful termination"
    - trigger: "WHEN the termination handler processes InstanceMsg::Cancel"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL publish WorkflowEvent::InstanceCancelled { reason: \"api-terminate\" } to the JetStream subject wtf.log.<namespace>.<instance_id>"
    - trigger: "AFTER publishing InstanceCancelled to JetStream"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL call myself_ref.stop(Some(reason)) to terminate the WorkflowInstance actor"
    - trigger: "WHEN DELETE /api/v1/workflows/:id is received for a non-existent instance"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 404 with ApiError { error: \"not_found\", message: <instance_id> }"
    - trigger: "WHEN GET /api/v1/workflows/<ns>/<id>/journal is called after termination"
      shall: "THE SYSTEM SHALL return a JournalResponse containing an entry for InstanceCancelled"
  unwanted:
    - condition: "IF the actor is already stopped before DELETE arrives"
      shall_not: "THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT panic or hang — it returns 404 (TerminateError::NotFound)"
      because: "ActorRef::call on a dead actor returns SenderError, mapped to TerminateError::NotFound"

    Key facts for context recovery:
    - Terminate flow: DELETE -> terminate_workflow (workflow.rs:70) -> OrchestratorMsg::Terminate (orchestrator.rs:34) -> handle_terminate (terminate.rs:8) -> InstanceMsg::Cancel (instance.rs:65) -> handle_cancel (handlers.rs:143) -> append_event InstanceCancelled -> myself_ref.stop()
    - InstanceCancelled variant: WorkflowEvent::InstanceCancelled { reason: String } at events/mod.rs:28
    - JetStream subject: wtf.log.<namespace>.<instance_id> at journal.rs:54-56
    - Test file: crates/wtf-actor/tests/terminate_e2e.rs (new file)
    - Requires: NATS running (docker start wtf-nats-test), provision_streams called, real NatsClient as EventStore
    - Verification: replay journal via ReplayStream, check for InstanceCancelled; check actor stopped via GetStatus returning ActorDied
    - ACTOR_CALL_TIMEOUT: 5s at handlers/mod.rs:26
    - INSTANCE_CALL_TIMEOUT: check master/handlers/mod.rs for exact value

completion_checklist:
  tests:
    - "[ ] Integration test: terminate running workflow returns Ok / InstanceCancelled published"
    - "[ ] Integration test: journal contains InstanceCancelled after terminate"
    - "[ ] Integration test: actor is stopped after terminate (GetStatus returns ActorDied)"
    - "[ ] Integration test: terminate non-existent instance returns TerminateError::NotFound"
    - "[ ] cargo test -p wtf-actor --test terminate_e2e passes"
    - "[ ] cargo test --workspace passes (no regressions)"
  code:
    - "[ ] Zero unwrap() or expect() in test code"
    - "[ ] Test uses real NatsClient, not mocks"
    - "[ ] JetStream streams provisioned before test runs"
    - "[ ] Actors cleaned up after test (stop or let supervision handle it)"
    - "[ ] InstanceCancelled reason verified as \"api-terminate\""
  ci:
    - "[ ] cargo test -p wtf-actor --test terminate_e2e passes"

  design_decisions:
    - decision: "Test at actor level (not HTTP level) — use OrchestratorMsg::Terminate directly"
      rationale: "Actor-level tests are faster, don't require spawning axum server, and directly verify the actor chain. HTTP-level tests are covered by separate bead."
      reversible: true
    - decision: "Use real NatsClient, not mocks"
      rationale: "The whole point of E2E is to verify real JetStream persistence of InstanceCancelled. Mocks would not catch serialization or publish failures."
      reversible: false
    - decision: "Use procedural paradigm with long sleep for test workflow"
      rationale: "Procedural is simplest — just register a WorkflowFn. FSM/DAG require full definition objects. Sleep keeps instance alive long enough to send cancel."
      reversible: true
