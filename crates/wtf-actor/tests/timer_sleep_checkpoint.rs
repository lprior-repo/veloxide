//! Bug regression: TimerFired must create a checkpoint so ctx.sleep() can replay.
//!
//! BUG: apply_event ignores TimerScheduled (doesn't track op_id) and TimerFired
//! (doesn't create a checkpoint). After restart, ctx.sleep() finds no checkpoint
//! for the sleep operation and re-schedules a new timer — double-firing.
//!
//! Fix:
//!   - TimerScheduled: increment operation_counter, store timer_id → op_id mapping.
//!   - TimerFired: look up op_id from mapping, create checkpoint_map[op_id].
